## Security Notes

>[!IMPORTANT]
Due to the age and experimental nature of the project, I don't recommend using it for public deployment or for installations with many users.

This application requires administrative access to Authelia's configuration and database. It should be deployed behind proper authentication and only accessible by authorized administrators.
